      <h1>Quick blurb</h1>
      I am a proud father of 3. I enjoy live music, reading, learning, and home improvement. I started my IT career in 1998. In my career, I have been fortunate to have worked with many great companies and great teams. I tend to succeed best when working in a high-functioning team along with other high-performing team members. 
      Collaoration is extreamly important to me. I enjoy being challenged and working with cutting-edge technologies. I have worked remotely since 2017, but I would like to return to working face-to-face in an office. I have a long history with Microsoft technologies, but more energized by open source projects. I still have ~20 years left in my career and want to make the most of it. 
      <p>I still have so much to learn.</p>

            suffice for the size of repository of OneStream's codebase. I then migrated all code from Bitbucket to Azure DevOps.

          I built an automated pipeline to provide the development team with the ability to create a Kubernetes cluster for testing purposes. A front-end webpage gathers username, email address, 
          purpose, cluster name, and an expiration date. This information is saved to a git repository in JSON format. My pipeline is triggered upon a change to this repository. 
          The pipeline build this Kubernetes cluster based on the information provided. Once the cluster is created, a Helm chart is used to deploy Prometheus, Grafana, and Alert Manager to the cluster.  
          At this time the exposed Prometheus endpoint is added as a data source to a centralized Grafana implementation. The user then receives an email with all the information they need to begin using their cluster. 
          A sperate pipeline runs daily to identify expired clusters and complete the deletion process.<br><a href="https://github.com/theautoroboto/kubernetes-onboarding">See the solution here</a><br>View the Grafana PKS SLI dashboard <a href="images/pks_sli.png">HERE</a>

          The QA group utilized 50+ virtual workstations to automate their testing. Every so often I would hear the VMWare administrators 
          complain about these systems because QA would call reporting they needed more system resources assigned. After a few conversations, 
          I found this was due to the systems never being rebooted. QA did not want the systems rebooted because it required them to manually 
          log in to each of the 50+ machines and manually enter a different user name and password 5 times to start their RUBY 
          processes and map the required drives.  I was able to deconstruct their current process into 2 separate PowerShell scripts. 
          This produced a very happy QA team and allowed the VM administrators the ability to reboot the virtual workstations.

          needed a common static attribute to assign to user objects outside of a GUID.  My automated process achieved what was previously thought to be unachievable. 
          While a properly configured Identity and Access management system would have achieved this, it was not in the budget in the foreseeable future. <br><a href="documents/Grange/ImageImport_Technical_Specification.htm">Tech spec</a>

          I was chosen to architect and implement PeopleSoft General Ledger. This required file imports from several different systems. 
          PeopleSoft did not have a method of completing this task without manually running a command directly on the server. I created a process to monitor a folder and act upon the file as directed. 
          The process would run the VB Script on the PeopleSoft server from the central FTP server location. 
          This provided additional auditing, reporting, and centralized administration.

          Not having a clue what I was doing, they loaded me up with all the components I would need to build a PC. Living in an apartment alone with no option for entertainment other than my childhood gaming system, this was a conquest. 
          Of all the opportunities I have been provided, this may have been the most impactful. I honestly I felt I was doing something others I knew could not do. I thought I would never get this computer running. I would get the display working and the keyboard would stop. 
          I would get the keyboard working and the mouse would stop. A few weeks later I was up and running with Windows 95 and on AOL with my 14.4 modem. Man, I was proud.  When others would say they had a Gateway, or Acer, or Compaq; I proudly said "I built my own".
